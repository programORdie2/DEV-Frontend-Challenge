# DEV Frontend Challenge

_This is a submission for DEV Challenge v24.03.20, Glam Up My Markup: Camp Activities_

## What I Built
I built a sci-fi UI for the _**Glam Up my Markup**_ frontend challenge.

I used a very futuristic theme to move away from the traditional camp theme that has already been used by so many other websites.

It's a resizable site, which makes it usable for both desktop and mobile users.


## Demo

## Journey
I started with just styling the form, but I realized that was pretty normal.
That's why I decided to add a database feature, what made me knock with my head on my desk.

I learned tons of new javascript skills by making my own pie charts, because animating on the canvas isn't simple.

After that, I made some cool confetti and popup scripts to make it look better and spendt 2 hours on animating (yes, 2 hours, don't laugh).

## Credits
 - Stackoverflow for [lighten and darken hex colors](https://stackoverflow.com/a/13532993/22846888)
 - [ChartsJS](https://www.chartjs.org/) for inspiring me with the pie chart.
 - [Deta](https://deta.space/) for hosting the backend
 - Everything else (confetti, charts, popups and database) is made by myself!

### That's all, I hope you like it!
